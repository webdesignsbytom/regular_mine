## Profit

The value of 1 coin is £0.0031.
You have a pending balance of 0.06168774 MINTME.
First, you need to calculate the total value of your pending balance:

Total Value = Pending Balance × Value of 1 coin
Total Value = 0.06168774 MINTME × £0.0031
Total Value = £0.00019093254

Now, you want to reach £1, which is £1 divided by the value of 1 coin:

Target Value = £1 ÷ £0.0031
Target Value = 322.580645 MINTME

To reach the target value of £1, you need a total of 322.580645 MINTME. However, you already have a pending balance of 0.06168774 MINTME. So, you need to earn the remaining amount:

Remaining Value = Target Value - Pending Balance
Remaining Value = 322.580645 MINTME - 0.06168774 MINTME
Remaining Value = 322.51895726 MINTME

Now, you know the remaining value you need to earn, and you are given a payout of 0.16070330 MINTME per 1M hashes. To calculate how many hashes you need to earn the remaining value:

Total Hashes Needed = Remaining Value ÷ Payout per 1M hashes
Total Hashes Needed = 322.51895726 MINTME ÷ 0.16070330 MINTME per 1M hashes

Total Hashes Needed ≈ 2,006,576.74 M hashes

So, you would need approximately 2,006,576.74 million hashes to reach £1 based on the provided information.
